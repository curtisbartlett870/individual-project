I have done the best I could to understand the project and deliver a result.
That is after I procrastinated until the last evening I had to do it.
I am positive that it does not fully meet the criteria because I am not sure
that I understand the criteria and I did not give myself enough time to 
attempt it and communicate the issues I am having. Admittedly a lot of it 
was a learning experience for me.

My cgi program opens and simply displays the string after the ? symbol.
Techincally that is going to be unique to whatever you enter.
It also displays a short message and has a picture to describe the way I feel 
in the background.

I got html help from www.w3schools.com.
What little cgi i used was from messing around with your program.
